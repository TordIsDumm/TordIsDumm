-DNI's ; imma keep it simple like sexists,homophobics,racists and so on. 
         But I don't like GI cosplayers that assume anyone from the DSMP is racist just because of most of the fandom.
         The reason of this one is because I experienced a tartaglia cosplayer call me racist withoit me doing anything,
         yes i was cosplaying dream.
